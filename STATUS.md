- Added password validation to change-password endpoint (was missing)
- Added CORS middleware (`pkg/middleware/cors.go`) — configurable allowed origins, methods, headers, credentials; preflight handling; wired into middleware chain
- Added IP-based auth rate limiting (`pkg/middleware/authratelimit.go`) — 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP, auto-cleanup, applied to login/register/resend-verification endpoints
- Added JWT token blacklist (`pkg/users/token_blacklist.go`) — in-memory revocation with auto-expiry sweep, integrated into TokenService validation
- Added logout endpoint (`POST /api/v1/auth/logout`) — revokes access token on logout
